When I was growing up, I was never sure what I wanted to do. I've always thought about doing marine biology because fish were my favorite animals to observe and I loved biology. Sounds weird but that's what I wanted to do and I thought I would enjoy it, I even took up AP Bio in High School and pass with a 4 on the AP exam. On the other hand, I also loved video games but I never felt computer programming would be something I would enjoy and even making video games didn't seem financially stable (neither is marine biology).

It wasn't until I finally entered college and actually experience coding. On the first day of ICS 111: Intro to Java, I fell in loved with computer science and changed my major immediately. I'm in ICS 314: Software Engineering now and once never felt regret changing my major, this is what I want to do. I want to code, I want to develop projects, the only problem right now is that I'm lazy. I hope I can jumpstart this passion so that I can start taking more initiative in learning and exploring career options. I don't want to start with game development but I do want to try in the future. As of right now, I'm not sure what I want to do as a job but I'm interested in software or web development.

As I am now starting ICS 314. I hope to learn a lot about strategies and career options for software or web development. Javascript right now is very interesting and popular language in web development which I can't wait to learn more about. I hope to work efficiently and to think outside of the box when it comes to solving problems. The most important thing I want to get out of this class is to jumpstart my passion for programming and do what I love.
