  Design Patterns are like a factorial pattern, you take the previous design and improve upon it, making it bigger and better. Design patterns are designs that solve problems within in similar context but different situations. Design patterns can be considered the forefront of solving problem, because not only does it solve one, it can solve millions of problems. This is extremely helpful in software engineering as we can apply a design pattern for an application, that can solve any problem that's asscoitated with a design pattern.
