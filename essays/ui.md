  User interface, UI for short, is the frontmost part of software development, because it's what people will see. Using HTML, UI can be made by many different frameworks, most commonly CSS, a simple but very versatile coding language. CSS can make UI nice, clean, and pretty. CSS however is easy to learn but hard to master, due to it's robustness. In CSS, trying to change the font color or size, would require to modify HTML tags such as <a>, <h> headers, <p> paragraph, and etc. within CSS itself or make a class for the tags to utilize. This takes time and it feels annoying to do it over and over and over. However, as stated before, there are other framworks such as Semantic UI.
  
  Semantic UI makes making a UI simple, sort of. With semantic UI, you can intialize a ton classes that can easily make a nice clean UI. If the user wanted to create a menu, semantic UI has class where a user can just type in the class, "ui menu", using a div tag and voila, anything in the div tag and closing tag will be part of the menu. The issue with this is the items will be lumped together.  In Semantic UI, the users can create a item; the item class is mostly used to separate things, so if the user wants to space out his menu, they would create multiple items for the menu to make multiple tabs. In semantic UI has multiple varitions and types for each class which can affect color, size, shape, and even alignment of items. Semantic UI, is actually similar to CSS, which it's easy to learn but hard to master. Even in Semantic UI, the user would have to do the samething in CSS to just change font size or color. However the only difference is that with Semantic UI there would be less clutter than basic CSS.
