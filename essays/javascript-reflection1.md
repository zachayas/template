I've experienced some Javascript before this, but it's all new to me. Javascript is very similar to other language like C or Java so it was pretty easy and fast to pick up. Javascript however has the best thing I've ever seen. I can make a function without a return type that's awesome and decreases the chances of bugs. The input for the function doesn't have to a specific data type which is nice to because it accepts arrays AND other data types. Javascript's ability to make an array of objects with ease is interesting because of the way of acessing nested arrays or objects either by brackets or using array.object.

The WODs are a great way to teach us about how to think about coding. The practice WODs are similar but not in fuction but how to make it function. I feel learning methods for solving issues is a great way of learning and with the time constraint makes it even better. The time constraints but us under some stress on trying to figure it out because not only do we have to program we have to check if it works. Cheking if it works adds more stree or less stress because if it works we have to figure how to fix it within the time limit. This is why I feel the WODs are great because I feel people need to learn how to work under stress. I wish other classes could incorprate something like this style of learning, not all as I understand some classes don't work like ICS.

I really enjoy Javascript and actually would like to explore what Javascript can make, I understand it's used to make websites but just how far can we take it. I can't wait to experience more Javascript, I like it a lot more than Java or C/C++.
