This project our team called "Explosive Christmas" was a Java based game for ICS 111. The game was about blowing presents up as Santa drops them before they reached the houses. I was the team leader for this project as well as the person behind the idea. This project was due in December so I thought we should make a christmas game, and I live in an area where throughout December, people would pop fireworks, so I put those two together. As the team leader I basically had to make sure everyone was doing their part as well as to make sure their code works. I had to do coding as well and I was responsible for the background, music, title, and the houses. When a present falls onto the house a meter would build up to represent the happiiness of that house.
