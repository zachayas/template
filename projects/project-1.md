The game is about blowing up presents as Santa drops them before they reached the houses, the game ends once all houses are filled up. I got the idea for the project because it was due in December so I thought we should make a christmas game and where I live, throughout December people would "pop" fireworks, so I put the two together. I was the team leader out of three. for this project, I basically had to make sure everyone was doing their part as well as to make sure their code works. I was responsible for the design and the interaction with houses. When a present falls onto a house a meter would build up to represent the happiness of that house. 

As the team leader I communicated often since I was in charge of the design of the game, with my team members to see if they were comfortable with any of my decisions. The only issued we had with my desicion was the background, I wanted to have a picture of a landmark in Hawaii because that's where my idea was based from. One team member didn't like that because this is suppose to be a christmas game and wanted it to change to the current one now. I resolved this by agreeing with him since I was only focusing on MY idea and when my team members actually suggested something I was being very closed minded about it. I was actually a lot happier with this desicion afterrwards.

Another issue was one of my team member was not very communicative with the rest of us. He wasn't being very productive and he wouldn't try to figure out issue on his own if we couldn't help him. How I got around this was to meet up with him and work on the project with him and show how to search for a solution to his problems. He was able to finish his part before the due date which was very close. 

Although we had these two issues with eachother, I felt that this project helped me become more open minded to my team members and improve my skills with helping others in my group.
