This project our team called "Explosive Christmas" was a Java based game for ICS 111. This was the first project I've done with a group and I was chosen to be the team leader. My role for this project was just to make sure everyone is doing their job. As for my coding role I was to build the main file and responsible for the houses in the game to fill up if a present landed on the house.
