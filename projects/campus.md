This is Campus Cloud, a program used to search through UH’s Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) list and discover new clubs to join. Anyone can create a account and search through a huge list to find anything that represents them. A search bar with a filtering feature, is useful to weed out all hundreds of RIOs. Users can also receive notifications as well as create their own tags for the filtering function. We even gave power to RIO owners the power to edit anything they want to their RIOs, and Admins can choose what a user can see. 

 This program was made by Zac Hayashida (me), Ross Kurizaki, and Ethan Chow. We used the Meteor and React Framework and used JavaScript libraries such as Semantic UI. I made the user page as well as helped design some of the layout for the program. I’ve also helped with keeping up to date with our github.io page. What, I’ve learned from this was connect things together, with multiple people working on different portions of the program things can cause conflict. Surprisingly, we’ve encountered very little conflicts, but it was very easy to fix. The problem we had was content, which I feel we still lack, but it is too late I feel. We have at least the bare minimum of our program and it works, almost fantastically. I felt my teammates and I have pulled through and actual made a decent program, even if it’s simple.
